<h1>Currency Converter</h1>

<h4>Brief overview</h4>
<p>Currency Converter is an Web application that helps users convert currency based on their selected country, with a simple and user-friendly UI. This application was built using HTML, vanilla css and Javascript.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p> <ul> 
  <li>The user have to just enter amount they want to convert</li>
  <li>They select the currency type in the "From" section</li>
  <li>They choose the target currency in the "to" section.</li>
  <li>Click on Get Exchange Rate to see the result.</li>
</ul>
  This application fetches real-time exchange rates using the Currency API.<br> 
<b>Note:[ API last updated was on 06-03-2024.

Additionally,I have also used <a href="https://flagsapi.com/">FlagsAPI.com</a> for dynamically change the flags according to selected currency.</p>
